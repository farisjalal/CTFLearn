# Chalkboard

### Approach

- Run exiftool to read the attached file's metadata. Attached comment contains a clue to the flag
  > The flag for this challenge is of the form:..CTFlearn{I_Like_Math_x_y}..where x and y are the solution to these equations:..3x + 5y = 31..7x + 9y = 59.

- Solve the equations to find the values of x and y, use them to obtain the flag.
  - x = 2, y=5
- Flag obtained : CTFlearn{I_Like_Math_2_5}
