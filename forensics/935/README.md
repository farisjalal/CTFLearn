### Approach

- The prompt suggests that the challenge has something to do with strings. So, I began by running 'strings' on the provided image.

- Multiple strings seemed like they could've been the flag, but only one matched the correct flag format (```CTFlearn{*}```), so that was the correct flag.

- Flag obtained : ```CTFlearn{Gandalf}```
